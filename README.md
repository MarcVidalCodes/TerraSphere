# TerraSphere

## Inspiration
A lot of young people spend a large amount of their time on their devices but have little time to appreciate and care for nature. We wanted to create something that young people would find fun, but also something that would help sustain our planet for generations to come.

## What it does
TerraSphere is an app that allows users to take photos of their ecological deeds once a day and be rewarded for it. Users are rewarded being eco-minded for consecutive days. Users can then redeem points for environment related prizes. Additionally, users can locate and participate in nearby environmental initiatives. 

## How we built it
We built TerraSphere using redux toolkit, react native, tailwind css, openai API and Google Maps API. 

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered many bugs with the point system and map functionality. It was also our first time using these APIs so reading their docs and getting familiar was a challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our determination that allowed us to delegate and complete tasks efficiently. We are proud that we all gave meaningful contributions and that the majority of our ideas were able to come together as one. Lastly, we are very proud that we were all able to focus for hours on end without losing motivation. We were able to complete the project a decent amount of time before the deadline because of this. 

## What we learned
We learned that being in a team is extremely valuable for any programmer. Despite each having our own individual tasks, we were able to rely on each other's strengths to help us all complete our parts.
